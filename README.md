Bluesnap API

Bluesnap is an online payment processor and also my employer.
This project started from a code-example I wrote for fun on the weekend to see how difficult is it to implement our own API.
Later on I used it to help Bluesnap vendors and finally I decided to take it one step forwrd and implement more calls to web-services.<br>

The following PHP code examples will demonstrate how to use Bluesnaps' API in order to implement the following web-services:<br>
1. create and update shopper entities<br>
2. place orders<br>
3. manage subscriptions<br>
4. use a token in order to "log a customer into" your Buy-Page<br>
5. Implementations of all kind of Bluesnap-API tools<br>
6. and more...

It is recommended to start with reading the Web-services section on Bluesnap documentation center: http://www.bluesnap.com/helpcenter/Static/default.htm
